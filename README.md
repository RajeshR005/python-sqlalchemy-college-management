# 🎓 College Database Management System – SQLAlchemy Based (In Progress)

![College DB Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RajeshR005/python-sqlalchemy-college-management/main/assets/college_banner.gif)

A fully functional **College Database Management System** built using **Python and SQLAlchemy ORM**.  
This project is a real-world application created as part of my internship, and it goes beyond basic student record management to implement **role-based access**, **department-wise control**, and **data integrity validations** — all tailored to manage students, staff, and admin functionalities.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This system simulates a real-world college ERP where each user role is restricted and empowered to manage only their scope of data:

- 👨‍🎓 **Students**
  - Can log in and update only their own personal information.
  - No access to other student data or academic records.

- 👨‍🏫 **Staff**
  - Can manage their own profile.
  - Can **view, add, and update students** only in **their own department**.

- 🧑‍💼 **Admin**
  - Has full control over the system.
  - Can create/update/delete:
    - Departments
    - Students
    - Staff
    - Courses and Assignments
    - Course enrollments for students and staff

---

## 🧱 Features

- ✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- ✅ **Department-wise Isolation**
- ✅ **Course Enrollment Handling**
- ✅ **Student-Staff-Course Linkage via Relationships**
- ✅ **ORM-Based Models with SQLAlchemy 1.4+**
- ✅ **Scalable Architecture with Clean Design**
- 🔐 **Secure Update Operations for Each Role**
- 🛠️ **Future Plans:** Integration with FastAPI for UI, Authentication, and Web API
